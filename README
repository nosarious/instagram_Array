Instagram Array is the first attempt to work with the instagram API through processing.

It prints certain items and displays others.

It needs to have a class to store the variables for the array, and I need to figure out how to get more information on the people whose images are uploaded.

Basically I would eventually like it to take the most popular images.

find the following image specific information:

# of image likes
# of image comments
# of tags
Text of image
uploader full name

I also would like to find the following uploader information:

# of uploads they have made
# of images they have liked
# of comments they have made
# of followers
# of people they are following
# of tags they have produced

This is basically a data compilation to find the activity of those whose images have become popular. Are they active in the instagram community or not. It's a class project.
