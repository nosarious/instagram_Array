Instagram Array is the first attempt to work with the instagram API through processing.
This requires the processing http library, which you can find here:

Instagram array checks for the current popular images and retrieves a number of them for your consideration. 
It prints certain information to the console and displays images on screen as part of it's process. It is intended as a starting point for those who wish to access instagram images from within a processing sketch.

It needs to have a class to store the variables for the array, and I need to figure out how to get more information on the people whose images are uploaded.

Basically I would eventually like it to take the most popular images and get more information on the image and uploader for a project I am doing.

find the following image specific information:

# of image likes (done)
# of image comments (done)
# of tags (done)
Text of image (done)
uploader full name (done)

I also would like to find the following uploader information:

# of uploads they have made
# of images they have liked
# of comments they have made
# of followers
# of people they are following
# of tags they have produced

This is basically a data compilation to find the activity of those whose images have become popular. Are they active in the instagram community or not. It's a class project.
